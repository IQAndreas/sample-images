A simple collection of random images for playing around with.

Categories so far:

 * 100x100 color images (100 random images numbered from `00.jpg` to `99.jpg`)
 * 100x100 grayscale images (100 random images numbered from `00.jpg` to `99.jpg`)

All these images were from [_LoremPixel.com_](http://lorempixel.com/); I do not own the rights to them. I have downloaded and make public a small collection of the images...

1. ... so I don't have to strain their servers each time I recompile or refresh the page to test the code
2. ... so I can use my own file naming (it's much easier fetching `Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + ".jpg"` from the server than repeating LoremPixel's URL and hoping that the image isn't cached anywhere)
